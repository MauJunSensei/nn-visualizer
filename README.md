# Neural-Network Visualizer

A cross-platform desktop application for real-time, interactive visualization of neural networks. Built with Rust (egui/eframe) for performance and UI, and Python (via PyO3) for machine learning integration.

## Features
- Real-time neural network architecture visualization
- Interactive exploration of layers, nodes, and weights
- Python ML integration (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.)
- Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust (https://rustup.rs)
- Python 3.x

### Build and Run
```sh
cargo run
```

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Rust source code for the UI and backend
- Python integration via PyO3 (see future `python/` directory)
